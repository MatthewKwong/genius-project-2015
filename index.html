        <p>What is the Genius Project? The project is a 15 week time where students pick a project of their choice. This allows students to express their personality and persue their passions in life. The possibilities for this project are endless as it can be changing something in the student's community to improving upon a skill they'd like to improve upon. Over the course of the 15 weeks I have decided to do my Genius Project on,"How to become a better web-designer". Throughout this project I will post the creations I've made on this site.</p>

    <div class="week">
        <p class="date">March 8 - 14: <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery"target="_blank"> Learning JQuery</a>
        </p>
        <p>During this time I decided to learn a new programming language called JQuery. I originally planned on finishing this lesson in 1 month, but ended up finishing that week.</p>

    <div class="week">
        <p class="date">March 15 - 21: <a href="../genius-project-2015/draggableKwongEnt/DraggableKwongEnt.html"> Kwong Enterprises Revision</a>
        </p>
        <p>After learning JQuery I decided to go back to one of my previous projects to add a draggable effect to it. I was also wanting to learn how to insert audio into my site, so I added that as well.
            <a href="https://madam-ramirez.codio.io/K E/KwongEnt.html">Here</a> is the previous site before the added draggable sections and audio.

        <p class="date">April 5 - 11: <a href="../genius-project-2015/audio/audio.html">Music Player</a>
        </p>
        <p>This was made because I had wanted to make a music player before, but never really knew how. With the time off from school during spring break I decided to look up different functions of Javascript.</p>

        <p class="date">April 12 - 18: <a href="../genius-project-2015/door/door.html">Transitioning Door Animation and Joke Teller</a></p>
        <p>I began to research more about animations across this week. I began to make simple little animations using webkit transitions in CSS. Here is an 
            <a href = "https://madam-ramirez.codio.io/Webkit Animation Practice/WebKit.html" target="_blank">example</a>.  Throughout the week I have created this. The beginning of the site has a door like effect where there are borders top, bottom, left, and right sides of the screen expand out. For the content of the page I added some corny jokes.</p>

    <div class="week">
        <p class="date">May 12 - 15: <a href="../genius-project-2015/creativeDesign/CreativeDesign.html" >Videos and Text</a></p>
        <p>During Summit Solves I coded the circles with playable sound when they were clicked.  Later that day I was inspired by a site I went on during the week and realized that they had a video playing with text over it.  This was really cool to me, so I decided I wanted to learn how to do it. 
          I immediately began to work on it.  I uploaded videos and began to try and figure out how to get text over the video.
        At first I thought it would be easy, but after tinkering around I had managed to figure it out.</p>

    <div class="week">
        <p class="date">June 1 - 2: <a href="../genius-project-2015/keyPress/KeyPress.html" >Key Pressing Color Activity</a></p>
        <p>So today during Summit Reads as I was reading <a href = "eloquentjavascript.net" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a> I crossed an example that was engaging and interested me.  It made me decide to learn more about it and make something.
        I decided to make a keyboard activity where people can use the keyboard row of ASDF ; and have different colored squares appear.  As time went on I added a "night mode" where the background goes dark.  I think the next
        step of this would to add different sounds for each letter. *Press the enter key for an example*</p>
